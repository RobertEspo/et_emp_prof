Eye-tracking eye & mouth fixations in L2 conditioned by proficiency and empathy.

#####

# Methodologies

Speech rate as proxy for difficulty.

Phoneme distinctions
	ciga[R]o/ciga[r]o 				(trill vs tap)
	casa[] vs casa[s] vs casa[h]			(s aspiration/deletion)
	pinta[d]o vs pinta[]o				(d deletion)
	pe[d]o vs pe[r]o				(d vs tap)
	[s]anahoria vs [z]anahoria vs [TH]anaoria	(s vs z vs dental)
	rato[n] vs rato[N] vs rato[m]			(alveolar vs velar vs labial)
	raña vs rana					(palatal vs alveolar)

Allophone distinctions
	la[B]ios vs la[b]ios				(plosive vs fricative/approximant)
	de[D]os vs de[d]os				(plosive vs fricative/approximant)
	va[G]o vs va[g]o				(plosive vs fricative/approximant)
	Nasal allophones
	
Ask Gabi/Joseph for advice on segmental features to look at

OPTION 1:
XA methodology. "Is X the same as A?"

Listen to sentence stimulus with video of face producing it e.g., "Voy a comprarme un (ciga[R]o OR ciga[r]o) más tarde."
Show text of "match" and "mismatch" target and distractor e.g., "cigarro" and "cigaro". 
Listen to stimulus e.g., ciga[R]o OR ciga[r]o. 
Click 1 for match, 0 for mismatch.

Issue 1: No way to get at allophones (includes /d/ deletion and /s/ aspiration).
Issue 2: Doesn't really measure comprehension of audio stimuli, but lexical knowledge (folks might still be more inclined to choose the word with standard orthography). Might be better to use pseudowords that are phonotactically possible in Spanish e.g., "Compré un [sarrano/sarano] en la tienda." This would require a much more limited set of stimuli that controls for both vowels and consonants.
Issue 3: Does this really get at comprehension of the target sentence? An argument could be that when learners are exposed to new words, they need to parse them accurately, so eye gaze on mouth could act as cue to help parsing.
Issue 4: They will not know when the pseudoword is introduced, so the saccade might not be fast enough to give them mouth cues. This can be improved if we have it more like a conversation: "A: Me compré un [sarrano/sarano] en la tienda. B: ¿Qué compraste? A: un [sarrano/sarano]."

OPTION 2:
2AFC: "Which would did the speak say?"
Two conditions: 
Condition 1: Convo between two speakers (audio-visual) on zoom, so you can clearly see both faces. Speaker A: "Tengo que comprarme un TARGET". B: "¿Un qué?" A: "TARGET."
Condition 2: same convo, no visual.

The TARGET is a phonotactically legal Spanish pseudoword.
Participant then displayed a minimal pair between the pseudoword and its pair. e.g., sarrano and sarreno. Participant must select the target accurately.

# Individual differences
Language use/experience
Proficiency (LexTALE, DELE)
Empathy
Working memory

# Research questions

Does mouth gaze fixation improve comprehension?
Does proficiency modulate mouth gaze fixation?
Does empathy modulate mouth gaze fixation?
Is there an interaction between empathy/proficiency and mouth-gaze fixation?
Does empathy modulate perception of segmental features?

Is eye gaze on mouth conditioned by empathy/proficiency interaction?
Is accuracy conditioned by eye gaze on mouth?
Is accuracy conditioned by interaction between eye gaze on mouth and proficiency?

# How many participants?



# What proficiencies?

Casillas et al. (2023) found that for deciding if a sentence is a question or statement, empathy only was influential for lower proficiency (what was "lower" in that study?). Regardless, all proficiencies would be interesting for two analyses: one based solely on proficiency, another looking at the proficiency/empathy interaction.

# Hypotheses

## Proficiency:
	low prof = mouth
	high prof = eyes
	I expect it to be a curve -- eyes at very low prof, mouth at mid, eyes at high.
## Empathy:
	low emp = more mouth
	high emp = more eyes
	So far, studies show that high-empathy folk have an advantage in language processing. E.g., Orrico shows that they (L1) have more granular interpretations of intonation; D'Imperio shows that they (L1) make greater use of intonational cues to disambiguate homophones when possible; Casillas shows that they (L2) distinguish between statements/questions better in Spanish.
	Also need to look at other studies focused ONLY on empathy and face gaze fixation.

# Literature Review

## What do we need?
	Face gaze fixation modulated by EQ during speech in L1 and L2 (Robert)
	Pragmatic skills (e.g., empathy) in L1 (D'Imperio; Orrico) & L2 (Casillas) (Robert)
	L2 perception of segmental features (/d/ deletion, /s/ aspiration/deletion) (Robert)
	Speech rate and proficiency (Alex)
	Working memory and phonological loop (Alex)
	Face gaze fixation modulated by proficiency in L2 (during speech) (Alex)
