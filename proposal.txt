Eye-tracking eye & mouth fixations in L2 conditioned by proficiency and empathy.

#####

# Methodologies

Speech rate as proxy for difficulty.

correct vs incorrect --> does eye gaze differ between correct and incorrect based on empathy/proficiency?
	ciga[R]o/ciga[r]o 				(trill vs tap)
	casa[] vs casa[s] vs casa[h]			(s aspiration/deletion)
	pinta[d]o vs pinta[]o				(d deletion)
	pe[d]o vs pe[r]o				(d vs tap)
	[s]anahoria vs [z]anahoria vs [TH]anaoria	(s vs z vs dental)
	rato[n] vs rato[N] vs rato[m]			(alveolar vs velar vs labial) 

XA methodology. "Is X the same as A?"
	
Ask Gabi/Joseph for advice on segmental features to look at

# Procedure

Listen to sentence stimuli with video. Show "match" and "mismatch". Listen to target e.g., cigarro/cigaro. Choose match or mismatch.

# Social differences

Language use/experience
Proficiency (LexTALE, DELE)
Empathy
Working memory

# Research questions

Does mouth gaze fixation improve comprehension?
Does proficiency modulate mouth gaze fixation?
Does empathy modulate mouth gaze fixation?
Is there an interaction between empathy/proficiency and mouth-gaze fixation?
Does empathy modulate perception of segmental features?

# How many participants?

Check out power analysis.

# What proficiencies?

Casillas et al. (2023) found that for deciding if a sentence is a question or statement, empathy only was influential for lower proficiency (what was "lower" in that study?). Regardless, all proficiencies would be interesting for two analyses: one based solely on proficiency, another looking at the proficiency/empathy interaction.

# Hypotheses

## Proficiency:
	low prof = mouth
	high prof = eyes
	I expect it to be a curve -- eyes at very low prof, mouth at mid, eyes at high.
## Empathy:
	low emp = more mouth
	high emp = more eyes
	So far, studies show that high-empathy folk have an advantage in language processing. E.g., Orrico shows that they (L1) have more granular interpretations of intonation; D'Imperio shows that they (L1) make greater use of intonational cues to disambiguate homophones when possible; Casillas shows that they (L2) distinguish between statements/questions better in Spanish.
	Also need to look at other studies focused ONLY on empathy and face gaze fixation.

# Literature Review

## What do we need?
	Face gaze fixation modulated by EQ during speech in L1 and L2 (Robert)
	Pragmatic skills (e.g., empathy) in L1 (D'Imperio; Orrico) & L2 (Casillas) (Robert)
	L2 perception of segmental features (/d/ deletion, /s/ aspiration/deletion) (Robert)
	Speech rate and proficiency (Alex)
	Working memory and phonological loop (Alex)
	Face gaze fixation modulated by proficiency in L2 (during speech) (Alex)
